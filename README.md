# Bonk The Fumo

## Overview

Bonk The Fumo is a fun and chaotic web-based game where your goal is to bonk every fumo that appears on the screen.

- Level progression and scoring features
- Fumos appear in dynamic, floating positions.
- and more to explore

## How It Works

The game generates fumo items at regular intervals that you need to bonk (click). It listens for clicks and mouse movement, then checks if your click hits the fumo.

## How to Use

Assuming you've forked the repo and are running a local server or using the demo app:

1. Click the Start Game button.
2. Wait until a fumo appears.
3. Click the fumo that appears, or move your cursor over it and press Z.
4. Keep bonking the fumos until you give up. The game ends when the life bar is empty.
